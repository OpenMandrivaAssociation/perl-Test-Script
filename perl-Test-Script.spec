%description
The intent of this module is to provide a series of basic tests for scripts in
the bin directory of your Perl distribution.

Further, it aims to provide them with perfect platform-compatibility and in a
way that is as unobtrusive as possible.

That is, if the program works on a platform, then Test::Script should also work
on that platform.

In doing so, it is hoped that Test::Script can become a module that you can
safely make a dependency of your module, without risking your module not
working on some platform because of the dependency.

Where a clash exists between wanting more functionality and maintaining
platform safety, this module will err on the side of platform safety.
